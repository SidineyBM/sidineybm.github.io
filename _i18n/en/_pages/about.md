I am a researcher in mathematical physics, with a Ph.D. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/en/graduate/applied-mathematics) from the State University of Campinas ([Unicamp](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/)). My work focuses on topological, geometric, and logical methods for non-classical phenomena — particularly contextuality — with applications in quantum resources and the foundations of physics.

I hold an M.Sc. in [Mathematics](http://www.pma.uem.br/website-in-english/home) from the State University of Maringá ([UEM](https://www.cpr.uem.br/international/index.php/en/)), where I studied conformal transformations and their applications in relativity, quantization, conformal field theory, and string theory. My B.Sc. in [Physics](http://www.dfi.uem.br/fisica/), also from [UEM](https://www.cpr.uem.br/international/index.php/en/), involved research in classical field theory, general relativity, and electromagnetism, as well as Lie groups, algebraic structures, and topology.

I have collaborated with research groups such as Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group ([MathFoundQ](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/)) and National Institute of Science and Technology for Quantum Information ([INCT-IQ](https://inctiq.if.ufrj.br/)), and I am currently a full-time researcher at QuIIN – Quantum Industrial Innovation ([EMBRAPII](https://embrapii.org.br) [CIMATEC](https://www.senaicimatec.com.br)), working in quantum technologies.

My main areas of interest include contextuality, quantum foundations, geometric and topological methods in physics, and the interplay between logic, symmetry, and the foundations of physical theories.
